Honesty Pledge

I promise to follow the academic honesty requirements of the Binghamton University. I understand that the minimum penalty for cheating is getting a grade of 0 for this assignment. If I am caught cheating again, I will get an F grade for the course and I will be reported to the University.

I understand the honesty pledge.
